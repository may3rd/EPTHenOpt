Welcome to EPTHenOpt's documentation!
=====================================

**EPTHenOpt** is a Python package for Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) Synthesis and Optimization.

This package provides a powerful, configuration-driven framework for modeling HEN problems and solving them using a suite of metaheuristic algorithms, including:

* Genetic Algorithm (GA)
* Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO)
* Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
* Simulated Annealing (SA)
* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
* NSGA-II for multi-objective optimization (e.g., Cost vs. CO2)

The framework supports parallel processing, detailed result reporting, and flexible problem definitions through CSV and JSON configuration files.
